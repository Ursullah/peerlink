# üöÄ PeerLink - P2P Micro-Lending Platform

**PeerLink** is a digital micro-lending platform that connects individuals who need small loans with others willing to lend.  
It brings **transparency**, **trust**, and **automation** to peer lending by using **PayHero** for instant payments, introducing **digital collateral**, **tracking repayments**, and building a **user reputation system**.

This project is built with the **Laravel framework** and demonstrates a complete, end-to-end lending cycle with real-world payment integrations, role-based access, and automated backend processes.

## üí≥ Payment Flow (Asynchronous)

1. **Initiation:**  
   A user action (deposit, repay) creates a pending transaction in the database and dispatches a Job (e.g., `InitiatePayHeroPayment`) to the queue.
2. **Immediate Response:**  
   The user sees `"Your request is being processed..."`.
3. **Queue Worker:**  
   A background `queue:work` process makes the actual API call to **PayHero** via the `PayHeroService`.
4. **Confirmation:**  
   PayHero sends a webhook to a public URL (managed via **Ngrok** in development) confirming whether the payment was successful or failed.
5. **Webhook Handler:**  
   The `PayHeroWebhookController` receives the notification, verifies it, and updates transaction status, wallet balances, and loan statuses accordingly.
